//! The typed runtime that emitted Rust targets: [`RecompContext`] (the CPU
//! register file) and [`Rdram`] (a checked memory view).
//!
//! # Why this exists (the whole point of `-native`)
//!
//! The N64Recomp C output reaches memory through raw macros like
//! `*(int16_t*)(rdram + (((reg + off) ^ 2) - 0x…80000000))` — a pointer cast
//! and a hand-written byte swizzle at every access. That is exactly the
//! byte-reinterpret bug class this project has been paying for. Here the
//! swizzle lives in ONE place, expressed as safe indexing on a `&mut [u8]`,
//! and every emitted access goes through a *typed method* (`load_w`,
//! `store_h`, …). No emitted code ever casts a pointer. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
//! at the crate root makes that structural, not merely a convention.
//!
//! # Semantic model (matches N64Recomp's `recomp.h`, clean-room from the ISA)
//!
//! - A GPR is a 64-bit value (`gpr = uint64_t` in the C). 32-bit results are
//!   sign-extended into it (that is what `S32`/`ADD32` do). We store GPRs as
//!   `u64` and expose typed read/write helpers.
//! - A KSEG0/KSEG1 virtual address `v` maps to rdram byte offset
//!   `v - 0xFFFF_FFFF_8000_0000` (i.e. strip the sign-extended `0x8000_0000`
//!   base). This is the `- 0xFFFFFFFF80000000` in the C macros.
//! - Sub-word accesses XOR the byte offset: halfword `^2`, byte `^3`. This is
//!   the N64's big-endian-in-a-little-endian-buffer convention. It is applied
//!   here in one spot, in [`Rdram`].
